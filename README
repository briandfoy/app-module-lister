App::Module::Lister is really just a single-file program stuck in a
fancy Perl distribution. To use it, copy the lib/Lister.pm file to
whatever CGI script name that you like and upload it to your no-shell
web hoster. Run the CGI script and see all of the installed modules
with their versions.

This module is also in SVN on SourceForge

Enjoy,
